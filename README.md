### 👨🏻‍⚖️ Disclaimer

> This is inspired by Sean Allen's take home interview course. I didn't followed his course yet. I just looked through his project mockup and test to see if I can recreate it myself using SwiftUI. 
> This is posted as a way to share SwiftUI learnings and to have some reference for when I need the feature.
